Under supervision of Vikas Jayathilakan:

a. Implemented PCIe Gen 3, 4 - SerDes and D-PHY IP designs in 5, 7 and 16 nm technology nodes.   
b. Was responsible for the complete back-end digital design flow – netlist to GDSII.  
c. Took ownership of design blocks with power-domains, wherein major work involved clock skew analysis, in-rush analysis, timing analysis (up to 2.5GHz clock frequencies) and physical verification. 
d. Underwent training on Test Chip implementation – from Bump Floor-planning to RDL routing. 
e. Demonstrated proficiency in automation and text-parsing. 
f. Apart from projects, took initiative and developed a generic leakage and setup optimization flow.
