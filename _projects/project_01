Using the [Hateful memes dataset from Meta](https://ai.facebook.com/tools/hatefulmemes/), we use an ensemble of NNs to solve the multi-modal classification problem. The classifier was in the top 17 in the hateful memesâ€™ classifier challenge by Meta. We also conduct several experiments on different fusion techniques and conclude that late-late fusion for both images and text work the best.
